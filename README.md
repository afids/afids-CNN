# Anatomical Fiducials (AFIDs) - Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) Model
AIMS Lab Research Team at the Robarts Research Institute - 2023-2024

*This package is under active development. It should be stable and reproducible, but please let any of the active contributing members know if there are any bugs or unusual behaviour.*

This Python package is a standard 3D [U-Net](https://arxiv.org/abs/1505.04597) (Ronneberger et al. 2015) machine learning model based on Snakemake and SnakeBIDS workflow management tools that leverages the recent release of the anatomical fiducial framework to solve the landmark regression problem on 3D MRI images. It is currently in development phase and contains tunable parameters that are not normally exposed in most other machine learning models; the user is highly advised to get familiar with the above mentioned workflow managaments tools and read docstrings and relevant documentation before using this software. Please see the [changelog](CHANGELOG.md) for more details.

## Installation 

### Installing Poetry
We use poetry tool for dependency management and to package the python project. You can find step by step instructions on how to install it by visiting it's official [website](https://python-poetry.org/docs/).

### Local Installation

After installing poetry, clone this repository via:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/afids/afids-CNN.git
```

You can then install the python package using one of the following commands, which should be executed within the repository folder (i.e., afids-CNN/).

To install the autoafids_prep package "normally", use:

```bash
poetry install
```
If you want to install in _develop mode_, use:

```bash
poetry install -e
```

## Workflow
Brief summary of the workflow along with its Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) can be found below. 

*Insert DAG image - inspired by khanlab/scattr*

### Processing landmark data (AFIDs)
1. Extract fiducial points from the landmark files (.fcsv is supported)
2. Generate a landmark Euclidean distance/probability map with each voxel communicating distance to an AFID of interest

## Train
Currently, the pre-processing and training workflows are separate, so you will need to feed your imaging data into the [autoafids_prep](https://github.com/afids/autoafids_prep) pipeline before using it to train the model. For more details, see [Known Issues](#known-issues).


## Apply
Similar to the [Train](#train) section, the pre-processing is currently detached and you'll need to feed your data through the pre-processing pipeline and then use the model for inference.   

## Known Issues
- Synchronize pre-processing workflow [autoafids_prep](https://github.com/afids/autoafids_prep) with training and appylying
- Factorize apply workflow to run per landmark of interest

## Roadmap

- Model optimization
- Extension to incorporate new modalities (i.e., CT scans)

## Questions, Issues, Suggestions, and Other Feedback
Please reach out if you have any questions, suggestions, or other feedback related to this softwareâ€”either through email (dbansal7@uwo.ca) or the discussions page. Larger issues or feature requests can be posted and tracked via the issues page. Finally, you can also reach out to Alaa Taha, the Science Lead for autoafids_prep.
